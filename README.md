# alchemlyb: the simple alchemistry library

[![Zenodo DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/68669096.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/68669096) [![Documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/alchemlyb/badge/?version=latest)](http://alchemlyb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [![Build Status](https://github.com/alchemistry/alchemlyb/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/alchemistry/alchemlyb/actions/workflows/ci.yaml) [![Code coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/alchemistry/alchemlyb/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/alchemistry/alchemlyb) [![anaconda package](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/alchemlyb/badges/version.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/alchemlyb)

**alchemlyb** makes alchemical free energy calculations easier to do by leveraging the full power and flexibility of the PyData stack. It includes:

1. Parsers for extracting raw data from output files of common molecular dynamics engines such as [GROMACS](http://www.gromacs.org/), [AMBER](http://ambermd.org/), [NAMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/) and [other simulation codes](https://alchemlyb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parsing.html).

2. Subsamplers for obtaining uncorrelated samples from timeseries data (including extracting independent, equilibrated samples [Chodera2016](#chodera2016) as implemented in the [pymbar](http://pymbar.readthedocs.io/) package).

3. Estimators for obtaining free energies directly from this data, using best-practices approaches for multistate Bennett acceptance ratio (MBAR) [Shirts2008](#shirts2008) and BAR (from [pymbar](http://pymbar.readthedocs.io/)) and thermodynamic integration (TI).
