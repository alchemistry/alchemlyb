alchemlyb: the simple alchemistry library
=========================================

**alchemlyb** is a library for doing alchemical free energy calculations more easily.

It seeks to provide flexible building blocks covering functions for parsing data from formats common to existing MD engines, subsampling these data, fitting these data with an estimator to obtain free energies, and plotting the results.

These functions are simple in usage and pure in scope, and can be chained together to build customized analyses of data. General and robust workflows following best practices are also provided, which can be used as reference implementations and examples.

**alchemlyb** seeks to be as boring and simple as possible to enable more complex work. Its components allow work at all scales, from use on small systems using a single workstation to larger datasets that require distributed computing using libraries such as `dask`_.

The library is *under active development*. However, it is used by multiple groups in a production environment. We use `semantic versioning`_ to indicate clearly what kind of changes you may expect between releases. Within any major release (1.x, 2.x, ...), the API is stable and is guaranteed to remain backwards-compatible.

.. Note::   
   The **current 2.x release** of alchemlyb *only* supports `pymbar`_ releases **>= 4.0**.
   (Previous 1.x releases only support pymbar >= 3.0.5, <4.) See `discussion #205`_ and `issue #207`_.

See :ref:`contact` for how to get in touch if you have questions or find problems.

Core philosophy
---------------
With its goal to remain simple to use, **alchemlyb**'s design philosophy follows the following points:

1. Use functions when possible, classes only when necessary (or for estimators, see (2)).
2. For estimators, mimic the **scikit-learn** API as much as possible.
3. Aim for a consistent interface throughout, e.g. all parsers take similar inputs and yield a common set of outputs.

For more details, see the Roadmap_.

Development model
-----------------
This is an open-source project, the hope of which is to produce a library with which the community is happy.
To enable this, the library is a community effort.
Development is done in the open on `GitHub`_.

Software engineering best-practices are used throughout, including continuous integration testing via Github Actions, up-to-date documentation, and regular releases.

.. Note::
   The alchemlyb project uses `SPEC 0`_ to determine which versions of  Python, NumPy_, and pandas_  will be supported.
   When we release a new major or minor version, alchemlyb will support *at least all minor versions of Python introduced and released in the prior 3 years from the release date*, and *all minor versions of NumPy and pandas released in the prior 2 years from the anticipated release date*.
