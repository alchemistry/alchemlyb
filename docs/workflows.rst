Though **alchemlyb** is a library offering great flexibility in deriving free
energy estimate, it also provides workflows that provides automatic analysis

For developers, the skeleton of the workflow should follow the example in
:class:`alchemlyb.workflows.base.WorkflowBase`.

.. currentmodule:: alchemlyb.workflows

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: workflows
