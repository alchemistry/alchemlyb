04/27/2021 wehs7661, dotsdl, xiki-tempula, orbeckst

  * 0.4.0

Enhancements
  - Allow the dhdl from TI estimator to be separated for multiple lambda 
    (PR #121).
  - Allow the convergence to be plotted. (PR #121)
  - Allow automatic sorting and duplication removal during subsampling
    (issue #118, PR #119).
  - Allow statistical_inefficiency to work on multiindex series. (issue #116,
    PR #117)
  - Allow the overlap matrix of the MBAR estimator to be plotted. (issue #73,
    PR #107)
  - Allow the dhdl of the TI estimator to be plotted. (issue #73, PR #110)
  - Allow the dF states to be plotted. (issue #73, PR #112)

Deprecations
  - Last version that is tested against Python 3.5 and 2.7.

Fixes
  - removed redundant statistical inefficiency calculation in
    `alchemlyb.preprocessing.subsampling.equilibrium_detection`

Changes


01/16/2020 dotsdl, orbeckst

  * 0.3.1

Enhancements

Deprecations

Fixes
  - added explicit `return_theta=True` for call to pymbar.MBAR.getFreeEnergyDifferences,
    as this was happening prior to changes in `pymbar` without the explicit call
