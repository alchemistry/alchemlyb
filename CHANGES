  * don't ever delete anything.
  * keep the format consistent (79 char width, M/D/Y date format) and do not
    use tabs but use spaces for formatting
  * accompany each entry with github issue/PR number (Issue #xyz)

  * 0.5.0

Changes
  - alchemlyb adopts NEP29
    https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html
    to effectively only support the last 2-3 minor Python versions    
  - Removed support for Python 2.7 and 3.6 (issue #130, #140):
    supported/tested Python versions are 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 on
    Linux, macOS, and Windows
  - The scipy constant for gas constant is used for parsers instead of the
    constants used by the corresponding MD engine (issue #125, PR #129).
    This leads to small changes in results from GROMACS simulations in kT
    compared to the previous releases, with a relative difference on the order
    of 1e-7.    
  - Added unit-awareness: the base unit remains kT but dataframes need to
    carry the unit and temperature in a DataFrame.attrs so that dataframes
    can be easily converted to different energy units (issue #125)
  - The parser outputs dataframe with metadata (issue #125, PR #129).    
  - Visualisation module will change the data according to input unit
    (issue #125, PR #129).
  - Bump the minimum pandas version to 1.2 (issue #130, #140).

Enhancements
  - postprocessors.units module for unit conversion (issue #125, PR #129).
  - pass_attrs decorator for safely passing variable (issue #125, PR #129).
  - alchemlyb.concat added to replace pd.concat (issue #125, PR #129).

Fixes
  - `alchemlyb.concat()` should raise ValueError when given empty list, to be
    compatible with pandas.concat() (issue #150, PR #152).
  - Fix the support for pandas >= 1.3 by skipping 1.3.0 (issue #147, PR #148).
  - Fix separate_dhdl not work for multiple columns (issue #149, PR #151).

  * 0.4.2

Fixes
  - added back documentation that was lost in 0.4.1 release (#136)


06/01/2021 xiki-tempula, orbeckst

  * 0.4.1

Enhancements

Deprecations
  - Last release that supports Python 3.5 and 2.7.

Fixes
  - The plotting function assumes that the default unit is kcal/mol where it is
    kT (issue #124, PR #123).
  - invalid escape sequence in plotting annotations (issue #133)

Changes


04/27/2021 wehs7661, dotsdl, xiki-tempula, orbeckst

  * 0.4.0

Enhancements
  - Allow the dhdl from TI estimator to be separated for multiple lambda 
    (PR #121).
  - Allow the convergence to be plotted. (PR #121)
  - Allow automatic sorting and duplication removal during subsampling
    (issue #118, PR #119).
  - Allow statistical_inefficiency to work on multiindex series. (issue #116,
    PR #117)
  - Allow the overlap matrix of the MBAR estimator to be plotted. (issue #73,
    PR #107)
  - Allow the dhdl of the TI estimator to be plotted. (issue #73, PR #110)
  - Allow the dF states to be plotted. (issue #73, PR #112)

Deprecations
  - Last version that is tested against Python 3.5 and 2.7.

Fixes
  - removed redundant statistical inefficiency calculation in
    `alchemlyb.preprocessing.subsampling.equilibrium_detection`

Changes


01/16/2020 dotsdl, orbeckst

  * 0.3.1

Enhancements

Deprecations

Fixes
  - added explicit `return_theta=True` for call to pymbar.MBAR.getFreeEnergyDifferences,
    as this was happening prior to changes in `pymbar` without the explicit call

Changes


08/05/2019 dotsdl, orbeckst, shuail, trje3733, brycestx, harlor, vtlim, lee212

  * 0.3.0

Enhancements
  - Amber TI parser (#10)
  - Amber FEP (MBAR) parser (#42)
  - Gromacs extended ensemble parser (#14)
  - NAMD FEP parser (#7, #75)
  - BAR estimator (#40)
  - enhanced performance of Gromacs parsers with pandas.read_csv() (#81)
  - GOMC TI and FEP parser (#77)

Deprecations

Fixes
  - fixed TI estimator (PR #61)
  - correctly use pV and U in the Gromacs parser (#59)

Changes
  - defaults for statistical_inefficiency() are more conservative (#39)
  - API Proposal was upgraded to API Principles (and updated)

(Note: release number 0.2.x was skipped.)


05/27/2017 dotsdl, ianmkenney, orbeckst

  * 0.1.0

First release

Features:

    - Parsers for GROMACS, including reduced potentials and gradients.
