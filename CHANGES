??/??/2020 wehs7661, dotsdl, xiki-tempula

* 0.?.?

Enhancements
  - Allow the overlap matrix of the MBAR estimator to be plotted. (issue #73, PR #107)
  - Allow the dhdl of the TI estimator to be plotted. (issue #73, PR #110)
  - Allow the dF states to be plotted. (issue #73, PR #112)

Deprecations

Fixes
  - removed redundant statistical inefficiency calculation in
  `alchemlyb.preprocessing.subsampling.equilibrium_detection`


Changes




01/16/2020 dotsdl, orbeckst

* 0.3.1

Enhancements

Deprecations

Fixes
  - added explicit `return_theta=True` for call to pymbar.MBAR.getFreeEnergyDifferences,
    as this was happening prior to changes in `pymbar` without the explicit call

05/27/2017 dotsdl, ianmkenney, orbeckst

  * 0.1.0

First release

Features:

    - Parsers for GROMACS, including reduced potentials and gradients.
    - Subsampler functions for slicing, statitistical inefficiency, equilibration detection.
    - Minimally functional estimators for MBAR, TI.
    - high test coverage (works with data in alchemistry/alchemtests)
