# Summary

*alchemlyb* is an open-source Python software package for the analysis of alchemical free energy calculations, an integral part of computational chemistry and biology, most notably in the field of drug discovery.
Its functionality covers contains individual function-based building blocks for all aspects of a full typical free energy analysis workflow, starting with the extraction of raw data from the output of molecular dynamics (MD) packages, moving on to data preprocessing tasks such as decorrelation of time series, using various estimators to derive free energy estimates from simulation samples, and finally providing quality analysis tools for data convergence checking and visualization.

*alchemlyb* also contains high-level end-to-end workflows that combine multiple building blocks into a user-friendly analysis pipeline from the initial data input stage to the final result derivation. This workflow functionality enhances accessibility by enabling researchers from diverse scientific backgrounds, and not solely computational chemistry specialists, to utilize *alchemlyb* effectively.


# Statement of need

In the pharmaceutical sector, computational chemistry techniques are integral for evaluating potential drug compounds based on their protein binding affinity [@deng2009computations].
Notably, absolute binding free energy calculations between proteins and ligands or relative binding affinity of ligands to the same protein are routinely employed for this purpose [@merz2010drug].
The resultant estimates of these free energies are essential for understanding binding affinity throughout various stages of drug discovery, such as hit identification and lead optimization [@merz2010drug].
Other free energies extracted from simulations are useful in solution thermodynamics, chemical engineering, environmental science, and material science.
The *alchemlyb* software processes the raw data from MD simulations using key estimators from statistical mechanics, drastically simplifying the process of extracting crucial thermodynamic insights from molecular simulations.

Various molecular dynamics (MD) engines, including GROMACS [@pronk2013gromacs], AMBER [@case2014ff14sb], GOMC [@cummings2021open], and NAMD [@phillips2020scalable], offer distinct tools for performing free energy calculations.
However, the diversity in output formats and analysis tools among different MD engines complicates the research process.
Data generated by each engine requires individualized processing and analysis methods, hindering seamless collaboration and comparison of results.


The [alchemical-analysis.py](https://github.com/MobleyLab/alchemical-analysis) tool [@klimovich2015guidelines], which preceeded *alchemlyb*, addressed this problem.
Now that [alchemical-analysis.py](https://github.com/MobleyLab/alchemical-analysis) has been deprecated, *alchemlyb* continues to provide a unified, engine-agnostic analysis workflow.
Unlike its predecessor, *alchemlyb* breaks down components of the workflow into modular tools, allowing users to more easily customize their analysis.
This innovation enables consistent processing of free energy data from diverse MD engines, facilitating streamlined comparison and combination of results.

Notably, *alchemlyb*'s robust and user-friendly nature has led to its integration into other automated workflow libraries such as BioSimSpace [@hedges2023suite].
This further enhances its accessibility and usability within broader scientific workflows, reinforcing its position as a versatile and essential tool in the field of computational chemistry [^1].

# Implementation

Solvation free energy, a key physical property often computed by computational chemists, involves constructing two end states: one where the ligand interacts with water and itself (coupled state), and the other where the ligand interacts only with itself, mimicking the pure solvent and ligand in the gas phase (decoupled state).
The solvation free energy is then obtained by calculating the free energy difference between these two end states.
To achieve this, it is crucial to ensure sufficient overlap in phase space between the coupled and decoupled states, a condition often challenging to achieve.
Overlapping is facilitated by introducing a parameter `lambda` ($\lambda $) that connects the two end-states, resulting in a series of intermediate states.
MD engines simulate the system at these states, generating and accumulating free energy data.

*alchemlyb* offers specific parsers designed to load raw free energy data from various MD engines, converting them into standard `pandas` `DataFrames`.
Two types of free energy data are considered: Hamiltonian gradients (`dHdl`, $dH/d\lambda$) at all lambda states, suitable for thermodynamic integration (TI) estimators [@kirkwood1935statistical], and reduced potential energy differences between lambda states (`u_nk`, $u_{nk}$), which are used for free energy perturbation (FEP) estimators [@zwanzig1954high].

In *alchemlyb*, TI [@paliwal2011benchmark] and TI with Gaussian quadrature [@gusev2023active] estimators are implemented in the TI category of estimators.
FEP category estimators include Bennett Acceptance Ratio (BAR) [@bennett1976efficient] and Multistate BAR (MBAR) [@shirts2008statistically].
These estimators assume uncorrelated samples, and *alchemlyb* provides tools for data resampling based on autocorrelation times [@chodera2007use].

To evaluate the accuracy of the free energy estimate, *alchemlyb* offers a range of assessment tools.
The error of the TI method is correlated with the average curvature [@pham2011identifying], while the error of FEP estimators depends on the overlap in sampled energy distributions [@pohorille2010good].
*alchemlyb* visualizes the smoothness of the integrand for TI estimators and the overlap matrix for FEP estimators.
Additionally, the accumulated samples should be collected from equilibrated simulations, and *alchemlyb* has tools for plotting the convergence of the free energy estimate as a function of simulation time [@yang2004free] to detect potentially un-equilibrated data.

*alchemlyb* offers all these tools as a library for users to customize each stage of the analysis (Figure 1).
Additionally, *alchemlyb* provides an automated end-to-end workflow that reads in the raw input data and performs decorrelation, estimation, and quality plotting of the estimate.
This workflow allows for the estimation of quantities such as solvation free energy with minimal code.
Moreover, this facilitates more complex calculations, such as absolute binding free energy, which is the free energy difference between the solvation free energy of the ligand in water and the solvation free energy of the ligand in the protein's binding pocket.
